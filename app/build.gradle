// Problem Statement: To create a robust Android application that provides automated social media management functionality, we need a well-structured Gradle build configuration. This configuration must support reliable operations and integrate necessary libraries for automation tasks.

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    // Define the application ID uniquely identifies the app
    compileSdkVersion 33 // Indicates the Android SDK version to compile against

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.madhub.insautoreplyscript" // Application ID must be unique for publishing
        minSdkVersion 21 // This ensures the app runs on a wide range of devices
        targetSdkVersion 33 // Targeting the latest SDK version for optimal functionality
        versionCode 1 // Version code for app updates
        versionName "1.0.0" // Human-readable version name
        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner" // Required for running tests
    }

    // Problem Statement: We must ensure that the application can operate seamlessly across various devices and maintain performance.

dependencies {
    // Problem Statement: To facilitate the management of network requests and enhance the automation capabilities of the application, we require essential libraries.
    
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0' // This dependency solves the problem of API communication, making it easier to interface with social media platforms for automated tasks.
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0' // Addresses the challenge of converting JSON responses efficiently.
    
    implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.5.1' // This dependency enhances the management of UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, ensuring smooth user experience.
    implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.5.1' // Overcomes the limitation of managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner.

    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.9' // This library addresses the problem of serializing and deserializing JSON data, crucial for handling API responses effectively.

    // Problem Statement: To ensure continuous background operation for automated tasks, we must include services that support foreground services.
    implementation 'androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.7.1' // This library supports background task management and scheduling, allowing the app to perform tasks even when not in the foreground.
    
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.0' // This dependency enhances asynchronous programming, essential for non-blocking operations during user automation tasks.

    // Test dependencies for unit and UI testing
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2' // Basic unit testing framework
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.3' // Android JUnit extensions for UI testing
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.4.0' // Library for UI testing
}

// Problem Summary: This build.gradle configuration file caters to the need for a powerful Android application that integrates automation capabilities for social media management. By utilizing MadHub's features and supporting libraries, the app can operate 24/7 on various platforms, providing a seamless user experience with effective management of social media tasks. The libraries included ensure compliance with Android best practices and enhance the application’s performance and reliability.
